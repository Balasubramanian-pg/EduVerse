# Procedural Decomposition for SQL Interview Questions

Procedural decomposition is a powerful problem-solving approach that breaks down complex problems into manageable, logical steps. Let me explain how you can apply this technique specifically to SQL interview questions.

## Understanding Procedural Decomposition

Procedural decomposition is essentially the process of breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable subproblems or procedures. This approach allows you to:

1. Tackle one aspect of the problem at a time
2. Build your solution incrementally
3. Maintain clarity in your thought process
4. Identify potential optimization opportunities

## Applying Procedural Decomposition to SQL Interview Questions

### Step 1: Understand the Problem Statement

### Understanding the Problem Statement in SQL Interviews

Understanding the problem statement is the crucial first step in procedural decomposition for SQL interview questions. Let me explain this step with a structured example.

### Key Questions to Ask

When analyzing an SQL problem statement, always ask:

1. **What is the expected output?** - What columns, format, and limitations?
2. **What tables and data do you have access to?** - What schema is available?
3. **Are there any constraints or special conditions?** - Any filtering, time periods, or business rules?
4. **What business logic needs to be implemented?** - What calculations or aggregations?

### Structured Example

### Problem Statement

"Find the top 3 customers who spent the most in each product category in the first quarter of 2024."

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem

**Expected Output:**

- A list of customers (likely customer names or IDs)
- Product categories
- Amount spent
- Limited to top 3 per category

**Tables Needed:**

- Customers table (for customer details)
- Products table (for category information)
- Orders/Sales table (for transaction amounts and dates)

**Constraints:**

- Time period: Q1 2024 (Jan 1 - Mar 31, 2024)
- Ranking: Top 3 per category
- Measure: Total amount spent

**Business Logic:**

- Calculate total spending per customer in each category
- Rank customers within each category
- Filter for only top 3

### Translating Understanding to Approach

Now that I understand what's being asked, I can outline a clear approach:

1. Filter orders to include only Q1 2024
2. Join with products table to get categories
3. Join with customers table to get customer details
4. Group by customer and category to sum spending
5. Apply ranking within each category
6. Filter to only include ranks 1-3

```sql
WITH quarterly_sales AS (
    -- Step 1: Filter for Q1 2024
    SELECT
        order_id,
        customer_id,
        product_id,
        amount
    FROM
        orders
    WHERE
        order_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-03-31'
),

category_spending AS (
    -- Step 2-4: Join tables and aggregate spending
    SELECT
        c.customer_name,
        p.category_name,
        SUM(qs.amount) AS total_spent
    FROM
        quarterly_sales qs
    JOIN
        products p ON qs.product_id = p.product_id
    JOIN
        customers c ON qs.customer_id = c.customer_id
    GROUP BY
        c.customer_name, p.category_name
),

ranked_customers AS (
    -- Step 5: Rank customers within categories
    SELECT
        customer_name,
        category_name,
        total_spent,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY category_name ORDER BY total_spent DESC) AS spending_rank
    FROM
        category_spending
)

-- Step 6: Filter for top 3 in each category
SELECT
    customer_name,
    category_name,
    total_spent
FROM
    ranked_customers
WHERE
    spending_rank <= 3
ORDER BY
    category_name, spending_rank;

```

By thoroughly understanding the problem first, I've been able to:

- Identify all the necessary components
- Plan a structured approach
- Break down the solution into logical steps
- Build a query that directly addresses the requirements

This initial understanding provides the foundation for the entire solution and ensures that no aspect of the problem is overlooked in the final SQL query.

Before writing any code, thoroughly analyze what the question is asking:

- What is the **expected output**?
- What tables and data do you have access to?
- Are there any constraints or **special conditions**?
- What business logic needs to be implemented?

### Step 2: Identify the Key Components

Break down the problem into distinct components:

- Tables involved
- Joins required
- **Filtering** conditions
- **Aggregations** needed
- Any **sorting** or limiting operations
- **Temporary results** that might be needed

### Step 3: Plan Your Approach

Sketch the logical flow of your solution:

- Which tables will form your base?
- What **order will you join** tables?
- When will you apply filters?
- What calculations are needed?

### Step 4: Build Incrementally

Start with a simple version and build up:

- Begin with the core tables
- Add joins one by one
- Apply filters
- Implement calculations
- Add sorting and limiting operations

### Step 5: Test and Refine

Mentally trace through your solution with sample data:

- Does it address all requirements?
- Are there edge cases to consider?
- Can it be optimized?

## Concrete Example: Solving a Complex SQL Interview Question

Let's walk through a complex interview question using procedural decomposition:

**Question:** Given tables `employees`, `departments`, and `salaries`, find the department with the highest average salary for employees who have been with the company for at least 5 years.

**Procedural Decomposition:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
    - Need to find a single department (output is department name)
    - Need to calculate average salaries by department
    - Need to filter employees by tenure (≥ 5 years)
    - Need to identify the maximum average
2. **Identify Components:**
    - Tables: employees, departments, salaries
    - Joins: employees-departments, employees-salaries
    - Filter: tenure ≥ 5 years
    - Aggregation: AVG(salary) by department
    - Sorting: highest average salary
3. **Plan the Approach:**
    - Start with employees table
    - Join with departments
    - Join with salaries
    - Filter by tenure
    - Group by department
    - Calculate averages
    - Sort and limit to get the highest
4. **Build the Solution:**

```sql
-- First, identify employees with 5+ years tenure
WITH long_term_employees AS (
    SELECT
        employee_id,
        department_id
    FROM
        employees
    WHERE
        DATEDIFF(YEAR, hire_date, CURRENT_DATE) >= 5
),

-- Next, calculate average salary by department
dept_avg_salaries AS (
    SELECT
        d.department_name,
        AVG(s.salary) AS avg_salary
    FROM
        long_term_employees lte
    JOIN
        departments d ON lte.department_id = d.department_id
    JOIN
        salaries s ON lte.employee_id = s.employee_id
    GROUP BY
        d.department_name
)

-- Finally, get the department with highest average
SELECT
    department_name,
    avg_salary
FROM
    dept_avg_salaries
ORDER BY
    avg_salary DESC
LIMIT 1;

```

1. **Test and Refine:**
    - Consider edge cases: What if there are no employees with 5+ years tenure?
    - Optimization: Is the CTE approach most efficient?
    - Alternative: Could use window functions

## Advanced Procedural Decomposition Techniques for SQL

### Using Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

CTEs are perfect for procedural decomposition as they allow you to:

- Break down complex queries into named sub-queries
- Improve readability by giving meaningful names to each logical step
- Debug intermediate results independently

```sql
WITH step1 AS (
    -- First logical step
),
step2 AS (
    -- Second logical step using step1
),
step3 AS (
    -- Third logical step using step2
)
-- Final query using step3

```

### Using Subqueries

Subqueries enable you to:

- Isolate and solve one part of the problem
- Use the result as input to the next part
- Create a clear hierarchy of operations

### Using Temporary Tables

For very complex problems, temporary tables can help:

- Store intermediate results with clear names
- Break a complex problem into multiple simpler queries
- Improve performance for large datasets

```sql
-- Step 1: Create a temporary table for the first logical step
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE step1 AS (
    SELECT ...
);

-- Step 2: Build on the first step
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE step2 AS (
    SELECT ... FROM step1 ...
);

-- Final query using step2
SELECT ... FROM step2 ...;

```

## Common SQL Interview Question Patterns and Decomposition Strategies

### Pattern 1: Aggregation with Multiple Conditions

**Decomposition Strategy:**

1. Filter the base data first
2. Create groups
3. Apply aggregations
4. Filter aggregated results

### Pattern 2: Ranking and Top-N Problems

**Decomposition Strategy:**

1. Calculate the metric to rank by
2. Apply window functions for ranking
3. Filter by rank

```sql
WITH ranked_data AS (
    SELECT
        *,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY ... ORDER BY ...) AS rank
    FROM ...
)
SELECT * FROM ranked_data WHERE rank <= N;

```

### Pattern 3: Gaps and Islands Problems

**Decomposition Strategy:**

1. Identify start/end points
2. Group consecutive items
3. Aggregate within groups

### Pattern 4: Hierarchical Data (Manager-Employee)

**Decomposition Strategy:**

1. Start with a base case
2. Recursively build relationships
3. Aggregate the results

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE org_hierarchy AS (
    -- Base case (top level)
    SELECT * FROM employees WHERE manager_id IS NULL
    UNION ALL
    -- Recursive case
    SELECT e.*
    FROM employees e
    JOIN org_hierarchy oh ON e.manager_id = oh.employee_id
)
SELECT * FROM org_hierarchy;

```

## Performance Considerations in Your Decomposition

As you decompose problems, consider:

1. **Join Order:** Join smaller tables first
2. **Early Filtering:** Apply WHERE clauses before joins when possible
3. **Indexing Awareness:** Know which columns should be indexed
4. **Avoid Expensive Operations:** Like DISTINCT and ORDER BY on large datasets

## Communication Tips for SQL Interviews

When explaining your decomposition approach:

1. Begin by restating the problem
2. Explain your thought process before coding
3. Verbalize each step as you build the query
4. Discuss alternatives you considered
5. Mention potential optimizations

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Overcomplicating:** Sometimes a simpler approach works better
2. **Ignoring Edge Cases:** Consider NULL values, empty sets, duplicates
3. **Premature Optimization:** Focus on correctness first, then optimize
4. **Not Testing Mental Models:** Trace through your logic with sample data

## Conclusion

Procedural decomposition is invaluable for SQL interviews because it:

- Shows your structured thinking approach
- Makes complex problems manageable
- Communicates your thought process clearly
- Allows for incremental verification
- Identifies optimization opportunities

By mastering procedural decomposition, you transform from simply knowing SQL syntax to being able to solve real-world data problems systematically, which is exactly what interviewers are looking for.
